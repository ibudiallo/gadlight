# GadLight

Highlight google search results that are ads

* [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gadlight/ocgmjfkihacphicojjdffcikklpejhad)
* [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gadlight/)

## Why?

Not too long ago, Google decided they no longer needed to clearly demark ads from search results. They replaced the signature yellow background, that clearly encompassed ads, with an 11px font size text that spelled the word `Ad`.

## How it works?

Google search ads have a simple HTML structure. We add a yellow background color to all ads and users can quickly recognize results that are ads without having to read them or hunt for the small 11px text.

## What?

GadLight is a browser extension that has been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Edge. It highlights advertisement that appear in the search results. It adds a yellow background that makes it easy to spot ads.
