# GadLight

Hightlight google search results that are ads

## Why?

Not too long ago, Google decided they no longer needed to clearly demark ads from search results. They replaced the signature yellow background, that clearly ecompassed ads, with an 11px font size text that spelled the word `Ad`.

## How it works?

Google search ads have a simple html structure. We add a yellow background color to all ads and users can quickly recognize results that are ads without having to read them or hunt for the small 11px text.

## What?

GadLight is a browser extention that has been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Edge. It highlights advertisment that appear in the search results. It adds a yellow background that makes it easy to spot ads.
